# Contributing to Shell-Boost

:thumbsup::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::thumbsup:

## Getting Started

Shell-Boost's [open issues are here](https://github.com/LucaDillenburg/Shell-Boost/issues). In time, we'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors. An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from everyone.

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the **development** branch, creating a new branch called
  ```feature/new-feature-name``` or  ```hotfix/issue-to-be-fixed```.
  When feature is implemeneted or the bug is fixed create a pull request
  to the **development** branch. [Quick Git Flow explanation](https://medium.com/@muneebsajjad/git-flow-explained-quick-and-simple-7a753313572f).

- After adding new aliases or functions, don't forget to update ```README``` and ```bin/resume.sh```.

- Backward compatibility is a must.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). 

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.
